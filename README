           Welcome to the Lisaac compiler !

                        ~~~~

The first compiler for Object Prototype Language !

Install.
========

  make ;-)

Note for Windows/Dos: read our wiki at http://wiki.lisaac.org JBJB : A revoir!!!

For those who want to install everything manually:

    make bin/lisaac
    make make.lip
    echo "PATH=\"$(pwd)/bin:\$PATH\"; export PATH" >> /etc/profile.d/lisaac.sh
    chmod +x /etc/profile.d/lisaac.sh

Known Problems
==============

  * Doesn't work when lisaac is compiled with gcc optimization -fstrict-overflow
  
  * The compiler can crash on a deferred slot when using empty ARRAYs.
    
    The deferred slot in in VARIABLE. The VARIABLE object is created by
    TYPE_GENERIC for the NATIVE_ARRAY special case. This variable is used by the
    PUT_TO and ITEM instructions.
    
    When an array is created empty (using for example FAST_ARRAY(E).create 0)
    and the compiler can statically know that the array will be used empty for
    the first time, it will crash.
    
    There are two workarounds:
    
      - When you create the array, create it with an element and remove it just
        after
      - Or create it with a capacity of 1. This can be done in the FAST_ARRAY
        prototype directly if you don't know which array in your code triggered
        this error.
        
  * Perhaps related to the previous error: code generation can sometimes
    generate variables but don't declare them. This cause a C error. The cause
    of this isn't known yet. The best way is to avoid writing code that might
    trigger this error.
