Testing
=======

Tests are executed using [cucumber](http://cukes.info). You'll need to install
it to be able to run tests. On an unix machine where you have ruby gems
installed, just run:

    gem install cucumber

From now on, you can run tgests by running:

    make run-cucumber
    make run-cucumber-wip
    make rerun-cucumber

The different targets do different things:

* `run-cucumber`:     Run cucumber tests, not verbose
* `rerun-cucumber`:   Run cucumber tests that failed at full verbosity
* `run-cucumber-wip`: Run cucumber tests that represents features that are work
                      in progress (scenarios taggede with @wip)

Tests are in the directory `features/` and have the suffix `.feature`. The
syntax is very simple.
