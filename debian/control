Description: Object-oriented language base on prototype
 Lisaac is a small prototype-based programming language. The ideas in
 Lisaac are mostly inspired by Smalltalk (all values are objects), Self
 (prototype-based) and Eiffel (design by contract). It has the following
 features:
 .
  * pure object language
  * very fast (like C code)
  * dynamic and multiple inheritance
  * dynamic definition slots
  * static typing (invariant)
  * generic types
  * auto-cast type system
  * programming by contract
  * interrupt manager
  * include C code facilities
